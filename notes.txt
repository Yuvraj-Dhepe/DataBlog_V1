# Publishing 
For publishing to github pages follow the site:https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html
Rest: 
git checkout --orphan gh-pages #Creation of new branch
git reset --hard # make sure you've committed changes before running this! # This makes the gh-pages branch as the current one.
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"
git push <repo_name> gh-pages #Remember for current branch the repo_name is my_repo, but by default the name is origin.
