    "text": "Project Planning and Data Discovery\n\nProject planning using AIMS grid.\n\nBhavin patel who is a sales director of at Atliq hardware realizes the pains of getting sales insights and thinks of having a data analytical solution for this problem.\nHe calls a couple of people like an IT head or a head of data department and schedules a meeting on how exactly we should do this data analytics project.\nTogether with IT head, he also gathers other stake holders in the room together and they brainstorm on project planning using AIMS grid.\n\nAIMS grid\n\nAIMS grid is a project management tool having four components.\n\nFirst component is Purpose\n\nDetermining what is the pain point and what needs to be done to resolve the pain point\n\nSecond component is the Stakeholders\n\nIn this project who all will be involved\nThe main stakeholders involved for this data analytical projects are the marketing team ,the sales team who is facing these issues to do proper sales analysis\nIT team (The Falcons) a group of software engineers that AtliQ hardware has who manages all the software requirements of Atliq\nThe data analytics (The Data Masters) team which is inhouse\n\nThird component is the end result i.e., once the project is over what needs to be achieved\n\nFor the data analytics project the end result is to have a power bi dashboard something that our sales director or even Regional Managers can go and look into and it gives you a real-time information on the sales numbers\n\nFourth component is the success criteria after the project is over, how do we define that the project was successful\n\nIn our project scenario the success criteria would be, we want the costs to go down by 10% on management of these sales data\nWe want to utilize the saved business time by the use of dashboard to take data driven descisions and increase the growth of company by let’s say 10%\nDashboards uncovering sales order insights with latest data available\nSales team able to take better decisions and prove 10% cost savings of total spend\nSales Analysts stop data gathering manually (merging excel files) in order to save business time and reinvest it value added activity\n\n\n\nOther Important points\n\nFalcons team, manages the software of Atliq Sales Management which is keeping track of all the sales number so whenever they sell any computer or any hard days in any local region this software is printing the invoice so it has all the records stored in a MySQL database.\nData Masters team will reach out to Falcons and to use the AtliQ SQL database because this is the database which has all the records that we need for our analytics and what we’ll do is we’ll integrate MySQL. We will use MySQL as a source in our power bi tool and we will build dashboard on top of it.\n\nReal World Scenarios\n\nIn real world direct access of data from IT team is not allowed cause if the data volume is high we want to make sure that MySQL database is not affected by the queries that Falcons are doing in your PowerBi, so many times companies, have a Data Warehouse as part of the Data Ecosystem.\nMySQL which is also known as OLTP which is online transaction processing system it is a very critical system and a company cannot afford for that system to go down otherwise the regular sales operations gets hampered.\nFor any business analytics is important but then it’s a secondary thing so what companies do is they pull the data from OLTP which is MySQL in our case they do all the transformation which is also called ETL which means extract transform and load and after doing that transformation they store the data in a data warehouse.\nThere are various types of Data Warehouse management tools like Snowflake and there are various ways to transform the data like using Pandas or other data processing libraries.\nMost companies working on huge data analytical projects have another in-house teams who manage the data warehouse known as Data Engineers (The Data Miners).\n\nConclusion & Data Discovery\n\nAssuming our data is not that big, the data is simply taken from the Falcons, by our Data Masters.\nThe Data Masters will plug PowerBI directly to SQL database and build the necessary analytical dashboard. Also some times data analysts will spend their time to capture information for analytics, which might not be available in the organization at all. But for this project we will not do that.\nOnce the Data Masters have the data, they do data cleaning (data wrangling) and data merging (data munging), all this can be done via specialized software. But our data being simple we will do it via PowerBi itself."
